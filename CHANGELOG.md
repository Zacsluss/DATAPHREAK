## Version Numbering Strategy

### Stable Release (v1.0.0+)
DATAPHREAK uses semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) with a "vS" prefix for stable releases:
- **vS1.0.0**: First stable production release
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes or complete redesigns
- **MINOR**: New features, non-breaking changes
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes and minor improvements

### Development Versions (v0.x - v8.x)
Previous versions used incremental numbering during development phase:
- **v0.x**: Early development and testing
- **v8.x**: Mature feature development approaching stability

The transition from v8.7.0 to vS1.0.0 represents the project reaching production-ready stable status after extensive user testing and refinement.
